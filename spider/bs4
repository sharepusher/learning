Beautiful Soup 4 Python
Overview
This article is an introduction to BeautifulSoup 4 in Python.

If you want to know more I recommend you to read the official documentation
found here: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

What is Beautiful Soup?
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. 

BeautifulSoup 3 or 4?
Beautiful Soup 3 has been replaced by Beautiful Soup 4.
Beautiful Soup 3 only works on Python 2.x, but Beautiful Soup 4 also works on
Python 3.x. 
Beautiful Soup 4 is faster, has more features, and works with third-party parsers
like lxml and html5lib. 
You should use Beautiful Soup 4 for all new projects.

Installing Beautiful Soup
If you run Debian or Ubuntu, you can install Beautiful Soup with the system
package manager
#apt-get install python-bs4
Beautiful Soup 4 is published through PyPi, so if you can’t install it with the
system packager, you can install it with easy_install or pip. 
The package name is beautifulsoup4, and the same package works on Python 2 and
Python 3.
#easy_install beautifulsoup4
#pip install beautifulsoup4
If you don’t have easy_install or pip installed, you can download the Beautiful
Soup 4 source tarball and install it with setup.py.
#python setup.py install

BeautifulSoup Usage
Right after the installation you can start using BeautifulSoup. 
At the beginning of your Python script, import the library
Now you have to pass something to BeautifulSoup to create a soup object. 
That could be a document or an URL. 
BeautifulSoup does not fetch the web page for you, you have to do that yourself. 
That's why I use urllib2 in combination with the BeautifulSoup library.
