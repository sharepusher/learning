# Recursion is a process for solving problems by SUB-DIVIDING a large problem into smaller cases
# of the problem itself and then solving the smaller, more trival parts.

# Recursion is a powerful programming and problem-solving tool.
# It can be used with a wide range of problems from basic traditional iterations to the more
# advanced backtracking problems.

# While recursion is very powerful, recursive solutions are not always the most efficient.

# In some instances, however, recursion is the implementation of choice as it allows us to easily develop 
# a solution for a complicated problem that may otherwise be difficult to solve.
