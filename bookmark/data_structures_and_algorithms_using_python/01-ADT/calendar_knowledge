Julian calendar
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar
The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC (708 AUC), was a reform of the Roman calendar.[1] 
It took effect on 1 January 45 BC (AUC 709) (shortly before the Roman conquest of Egypt), by edict. 
It was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was refined and gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. 
The Julian calendar gains against the mean tropical year at the rate of one day in 128 years. 
For the Gregorian the figure is one day in 3,030 years.[2] 
The difference in the average length of the year between Julian (365.25 days) and Gregorian (365.2425 days) is 0.002%.

Julian day

Julian day is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period used primarily by astronomers.

The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon Universal time, with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on January 1, 4713 BC, proleptic Julian calendar (November 24, 4714 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar),[1][2][3] a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: Indiction, Solar, and Lunar cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history.[4] For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 UT on January 1, 2000, was 2,451,545.[5]

The Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.[6] For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2,456,293.520833.[7]

The Julian Period is a chronological interval of 7980 years beginning 4713 BC. It has been used by historians since its introduction in 1583 to convert between different calendars. The Gregorian year 2016 is year 6729 of the current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD 3268.
