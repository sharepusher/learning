What is higher-order function?
In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function(also functional, functional form or functor) 
is a function that does AT LEAST one of the following:
1) takes one or more functions as arguments
2) returns a function as its result

All other functions are first-order functions. In mathematics higher-order functions are also termed operators or functionals.

In the following examples, the higher-order function twice takes a function, and applies the function to some value twice.
If twice has to be applied several times for the same f it preferably should return a function rather than a value.
This is in line with the "don't repeat yourself" principle.

>>> def twice(f):
...    return lambda x: f(f(x))

>>> def f(x):
...     return x+3

>>> g = twice(f)

>>> print(g(7))
