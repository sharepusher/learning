Slice.
A snake appears near your foot. It moves from the invisible to the visible. Our vision reveals(like a slice) only a part of the world.

Summary:
a python slice is composed by 'start'(default 0), 'stop' and 'step'(default 1), all of them are optional.
The step means how many steps walked from the beginning.

What is a python slice?
a python slice extracts elements, based on a START and STOP.
We take slices on many types in python. We specify an optional first index, an optional last index, and an optionl step.
When we omit a value, a default is used.

How to use the slice in python?
Get elements from...
NOTE: index start from 0, and the default is 0, the step default is 1.

Start, end. In slicing, if you omit the first or the second index, it means "start" or "end". This is clearer than specifying 0 or the length.

Step: There is a third, optional index used in slicing. If the step is two, we advance two places after an element is copied.
This allows us to quickly access all odd or even elements in an array. No complicated loops are required.

Examples:
values[1:3] Index1 to index2.
>>> test = '01234'
>>> test[1:3]
'12'
values[2:-1] Index2 to the tailend(NOT included)
>>> test = '01234'
>>> test[2:-1]
'23'
>>> test[4:-1]
''
>>> test[3:-1]
'3'
>>> test[-1]
'4'

value[::2] Start through end, walk 2 steps each time.
>>> test[::1]
'01234'
>>> test[::2]
'024'
