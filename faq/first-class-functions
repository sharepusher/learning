What is first-class functions?
In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens.
Specifically, this means the language supports PASSING functons as ARGUMENTS to other functions, 
RETURNING them as the values from other functions, and ASSIGNING them to variables or storing them in data structures.

There are certain implementation difficulties in passing functions as arguments or returning them as results, especially in the presence of non-local variables introduced in nested and anonymous functions.
