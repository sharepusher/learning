# enumerate()
# will make certain loops a bit clearer. enumerate(thing), where thing is either an iterator or a sequence, returns a iterator
# that will return (0, thing[0], (1, thing[1])) and so forth.

A common idom to change every element of a list looks like this:
for i in range(len(L)):
    item = L[i]
    # ...compare some result based on item
    L[i] = result

# This ca rewriten using enumerate() as 
for i , item in enumerate(L):
    # ...compare some result based on item
    # update L[i]
    L[i] = result
