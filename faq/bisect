The bisect module offers two main functions: bisect and insort, 
which use the binary search algorithm to quickly FIND and INSERT items in any sorted sequence.

1. Searching with bisect
bisect(haystack(source), needle(target)) does a binary search for needle in haystack,
which must be a sorted sequence, to locate the position where needle can be inserted while maintaining haystack in ascending order.
In other words, all items appearing up to that position are less than or equal(<=) to needle.
You could use the result of bisect(haystack, needle) as the index argument to haystack.insert(index, needle), however,
using insort does both steps, and is faster.
