## Solution
You can use both dict.pop() method and a more generic del statement to remove items from a dictionary. 
They both mutate the original dictionary, so you need to make a copy (see details below).

And both of them will raise a KeyError if the key you're providing to them is not present in the dictionary:

key_to_remove = "c"
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
del d[key_to_remove]  # Raises `KeyError: 'c'`
and

key_to_remove = "c"
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
d.pop(key_to_remove)  # Raises `KeyError: 'c'`


It is possible to delete a key:value pair with del.
