timeit - Measure execution time of small code snippets

This module provides a simple way to time small bits of python code. It has both a Command-Line interfaces
as well as a callable one. It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution times. 

Basic Examples:
$ python -m timeit '"-".join(str(n) for n in range(100))'
10000 loops, best of 3: 40.3 usec per loop
$ python -m timeit '"-".join([str(n) for n in range(100)])'
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.4 usec per loop
$ python -m timeit '"-".join(map(str, range(100)))'
10000 loops, best of 3: 25.2 usec per loop
