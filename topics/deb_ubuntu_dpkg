## Description
Debian (.deb) packages are the packages that are used in Ubuntu. You can install any .deb package in your system.
1) .deb files can generally be installed from your file manager (Nautilus) merely by clicking on them, 
   since file associations with the default installer is already set in Ubuntu. 

2) Packages are manually installed via the dpkg command (Debian Package Management System).  
dpkg is the backend to commands like apt-get and aptitude, which in turn are the backend for GUI install apps like the Software Center and Synaptic.


## Operation
dpkg -i package-name-here.deb
dpkg --install package-name-here.deb
dpkg -i -R /path/to/dir/name/with/lots/of/dot-deb-files/
dpkg -i --recursive /path/to/dir/name/with/lots/of/dot-deb-files/

sudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME

Where,

-i or --install : Install the package.
-R or --recursive : Recursively installed all *.deb files found at specified directories and all of its sub-directories. 
/path/to/dir/name/with/lots/of/dot-deb-files/ must refer to a directory instead of package-name-here.deb file name.
