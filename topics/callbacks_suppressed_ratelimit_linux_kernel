Linux has a mechanism to avoid a DoS attack – with regard to logging – called rate limit(decrease the repeated message log record). 
The limits can be configured by tuning the files /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit and /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit_burst.

To disable this mechanism and allow every message to be logged, simply set the interval to 0:

# sysctl -w net.core.message_cost=0
