## Problem
After axure installation, failed to kickoff and pop up exception window.

## Research
check axure log
vi ~/Documents/Axure\ User\ Data/Axure-8-0/logs/error_log_2018-04-13.log

========== Beg Wrapped Inner Exception 0 ==========
System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'ai' threw an exception. ---> System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path "/Users/zack/.config/.isolated-storage" is denied.

File permission issue.


## Solution:
The direcotry owner is root, change it to current user.
