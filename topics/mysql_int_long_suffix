## Why do intergers in database row tuple have an "L" suffix?
It can be removed the "L" by passing values with int()
Because long integer literals were indicated with an 'l' or 'L' suffix before Python 3.
Since Python3, int and long have been merged into "int", which functions pretty much like long used to.
Do note that, technically, Python2's int was equivalent to C's long, while Python's long was more like a BigNumber-type
thing with unlimited precision.

MySQLdb convert ALL integer types to long type on Python2.x
