Go tags are space-separated between JSON and XML
NO space allowed in JSON tag or XML tag internally.

By convention, tag strings are a concatenation of optionally space-separated key:"value" pairs. 
Each key is a non-empty string consisting of non-control characters other than space (U+0020 ' '), quote (U+0022 '"'), and colon (U+003A ':'). 
Each value is quoted using U+0022 '"' characters and Go string literal syntax.

type Foo struct {
    Id          int64       `xml:"id,attr" json:"id"`
    Version     int16       `xml:"version,attr" json:"version"`
}

Could we use two json tag separated by space?
No. The tags are read sequentially, and the first matching tag is returned. â€“
