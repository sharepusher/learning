## Reference
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2464/timestamp-modification-time-and-created-time-of-a-file

## Three kinds of timestamps
1) Access - the last time the file was read
2) Modify - the last time the file was modified(content modified)
3) Change - the last time the meta data of the file was changed(e.g. permissions)

## Use stat to display them
