## Wiki
Copy-on-write (COW) is an optimization strategy used in computer programming.
The fundamental idea is that if multiple callers ask for resources which are initially indistinguishable,
you can give them pointers to the same resource.
This function can be maintained until a caller tries to modify its 'copy' of the resource, 
at which point a true private copy is created to prevent the changes becoming visible to everyone else.
All of this happens transparently to the callers.
The primary advantage is that if a caller never makes any modifications, no private copy need ever be created.

Copy-on-write means more or less what it sounds like: everyone has a single shared copy of the same data until it's written,
and then a copy is made. Usually, copy-on-write is used to resolve concurrency sorts of problems.
In ZFS, for example, data blocks on disk are allocated copy-on-write; as long as there are no changes, you keep the original blocks;
a change changed only the affected blocks. This means the minimum number of new blocks are allocated.
