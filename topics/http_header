It is a request header.
The HTTP client use this header to tell the server which encoding it supports.
The server is allowed to send the response content in any of these encodings.

The Accept-Encoding request HTTP header advertises which content encoding,
usually a compression algorithm, the client is able to understand.
Using content negotiation, the server selects on of the proposals, uses it and informs
the client of its choice with the Content-Encoding response header.

# Content-Encoding
It is a response header.
The HTTP server uses this header to tell the client which particular encoding the content
has actually been encoded in.
The Content-Encoding entity header is used to compress the media-type.
When present, its value indicates which encodings were applied to the entity-body.
It lets the client know, how to decode in order to obtain the media-type referenced 
by the Content-Type header.

If you want to see them play in action, ioen Inspect Element in Firefox/Chrome
Then check for the Network tab to see them in action.
Look for Accept-Encoding in request headers and Content-Encoding in response headers.
