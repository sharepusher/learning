return True if “file-path-here” is an existing regular file.

## os.path.isfile vs. os.path.exists
exists return True incase the given path is a directory or a file
isfile only return True if the path points to a FILE.
Directory and file are quite similar from the technical point of view.
A file can contain any kind of data.

A directory is just a special entry in the file system that represents the fact that it may contain files and other dirs.
It is a helpful means for building up a data structure.
A path is an unambiguous pointer to a resource in the file system. It can either pointer to a file or to a directory.
