## Reference
https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/working_with_pandas.html#ewx-pandas

Pandas writes Excel files using the Xlwt module for xls files and the Openpyxl or XlsxWriter modules for xlsx files.

## Using XlsxWriter with Pandas
import pandas as pd
# create a pandas dataframe from the data
df = pd.DataFrame({'data':[10,20,30,15,45]})
# create a pandas excel writer using XlsxWriter as the engine.
writer = pd.ExcelWriter('pandas_simple.xlsx', engine='xlsxwriter')
# write the dadaframe to an XlsxWriter Excel object
df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="my_sheet_name")
# close the pandas excel writer and output the excel file.
writer.save()

## Accessing XlsxWriter from pandas
In order to apply XlsxWriter features such as Charts,Conditional Formatting and Column Formatting to the Pandas output we need to access the underlying workbok and worksheet objects.
After that we can treat them as normal XlsxWriter objects.
