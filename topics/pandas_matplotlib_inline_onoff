switch the matplotlib's backend by %matplotlib <backend>
To switch back to your system's default backend use %matplotlib auto or just simply %matplotlib

personally highly recommend the notebook (a.k.a. nbagg) backend
 It is similar to inline but interactive
 allowing zooming/panning from inside Jupyter

 For more info try: ?%matplotlib inside an IPython/Jupyter or IPython's online documentation
