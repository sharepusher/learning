## Save Ojbejcts in Python
Pickle, which is part of the Python library by default, is an important module whenver you need persistence between user sessions.
As a module, pickle provides for the saving of Python objects between processes.

Whether programming for a db, game, forum, or some other application that must save information betwen sessions,
pickle is useful for saving identifiers and settings.

The pickle module can store things such as data types such as booleans, strings, and byte arrays, lists, dictionaries, functions, and more.

# The concept of pickling is also known as serialization, marshaling, and flattening.
# The point is always the same - to save an object to a file for later retrieval.
# Pickling accomplishes this by writing the objects as one long stream of bytes.

## Pickle Example in Python
import pickle
object = Object()
filehandler = open(filename, 'w')
pickle.dump(object, filehandler)

# To restore the value of the object to memory, load the object from the file.
filehandler = open(filename, 'r')
object = pickle.load(filehandler)

import pickle
import math
object_pi = math.pi
file_pi = open('filename_pi.obj','w')
pickle.dump(object_pi, file_pi)

file_pi2 = open('filename_pi.obj', 'r')
object_pi2 = pickle.load(file_pi2)

## Things to Remember
1) the pickle protocol is specific to Python. It's not guaranteed to be cross-language compitable.
You most likely cannnot transfer the information to make it useful in Perl, or other languages.
2) There is also no guarantee of compatibility between different versions of Python.
The incompatibility exists because not every Python data structure can be serialized by the module.
