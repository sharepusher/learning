## ApacheBench
ab is a tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. 
It is designed to give you an impression of how your current Apache installation performs. 
This especially shows you how many requests per second your Apache installation is capable of serving.



# ab POST request
 -p POST-file option which lets you POST a File containing data to POST.

ab -n 1 -p post -v 4 -T application/x-www-form-urlencoded "http://oz01.zappos.net/registrations"
>>> import urllib
>>> outfile = open('post.data', 'w')
>>> params = ({ 'auth_token': 'somelongstringthatendswithanequalssign=' })
>>> encoded = urllib.urlencode(params)
>>> outfile.write(encoded)
>>> outfile.close()

ab -n 10 -c 2 -p data/small.json -T 'application/json' http://0.0.0.0:9000/

# The json file is in {} format

import json
with open('data.json', 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump(data, outfile)
