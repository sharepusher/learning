findOneAndDelete()
  - returns the deleted document after having deleted it (in case you need its contents after the delete operation);

deleteOne() is used to delete a single document

remove() is a deprecated function and has been replaced by deleteOne() (to delete a single document) and deleteMany() (to delete multiple documents)

findOneAndDelete() should be able to delete on _id.
