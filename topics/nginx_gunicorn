## 1. why nginx with Gunicorn
# Many frameworks and application servers(including Gunicorn) can serve static files(e.g. javascript, css, images etc.)
# together with responses.
# However, the better thing to do is to let a (reverse-proxy) server such as Nginx handle the task of serving these files
# and managing connections(requests). 
# This relieves a lot of load from the application servers, granting you a much better overall performance.
# As application grows, you will want to distribute it across servers to be able to handle more connections simultaneously
# and handle a generally more robust architecture.
# Having a reverse-proxy in front of your application servers helps you with this from the very beginning.
# Nginx's extensibility(e.g.)
