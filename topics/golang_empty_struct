You can use == to compare with a zero value composite literal because all fields are comparable:

if (Session{}) == session  {
    fmt.Println("is zero value")
}

An alternative to comparing the entire value is to compare a field that must be set to a non-zero value in a valid session. For example, if the player id must be != "" in a valid session, use

if session.playerId == "" {
    fmt.Println("is zero value")
}

struct containing []byte cannot be compared
