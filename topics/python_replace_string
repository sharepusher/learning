// 1.str.replace
#!/usr/bin/python

str = "this is string example....wow!!! this is really string"
print str.replace("is", "was")
print str.replace("is", "was", 3)
When we run above program, it produces following result âˆ’

thwas was string example....wow!!! thwas was really string
thwas was string example....wow!!! thwas is really string

// 2. find, contain, in

If it's just a substring search you can use string.find("substring").

You do have to be a little careful with find, index, and in though, as they are substring searches. In other words, this:

s = "This be a string"
if s.find("is") == -1:
    print("No 'is' here!")
else:
    print("Found 'is' in the string.")
It would print Found 'is' in the string. Similarly, if "is" in s: would evaluate to True. This may or may not be what you want.




// 3. regex
import re
s = "Example String"
replaced = re.sub('[ES]', 'a', s)
print replaced

import sys
import re

f = sys.argv[1]
find = sys.argv[2]
replace = sys.argv[3]
with open (f, "r") as myfile:
     s=myfile.read()
ret = re.sub(find,replace, s)   # <<< This is where the magic happens
print ret
