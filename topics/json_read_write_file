## Load data from json file
# Reading JSON data back from a file called JSONData.json
#Use the method json.load()
#It's just load and not loads()
#Decode JSON Data
with open('JSONData.json', 'r') as f:
     data = json.load(f)

## Write json data to json file
# Writing JSON data into a file called JSONData.json
#Use the method called json.dump()
#It's just dump() and not dumps()
#Encode JSON data
with open('JSONData.json', 'w') as f:
     json.dump(jsonData, f)

# write a prettified JSON file which human eyes can read better. 
# For this, pass sort_keys as True and indent with 4 space characters and you are good to go. 
# Also take care of ensuring that the ascii codes will not be written in your JSON file:

with open('data.txt', 'w') as outfile:
     json.dump(jsonData, outfile, sort_keys = True, indent = 4,
               ensure_ascii = False)


# To avoid storing an encoded copy of the data in memory (result of dumps) and to output utf8-encoded bytestrings in both Python 2 and 3, use:
import json, codecs
with open('data.txt', 'wb') as f:
    json.dump(data, codecs.getwriter('utf-8')(f), ensure_ascii=False)
