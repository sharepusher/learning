## pickle disadvantages
Unpickling can run arbitrary code, and using pickle to transfer data between programs
or store data between sessions is a security hole.

JSON does NOT introduce a security hole and is standardized, so the data can be accessed by programs 
in different languages.

Apart from security, JSON has the additional advantage that it makes migrations easy,
so you can load data that was saved by an older version of your application.
Meanwhile you could have added a field, or replaced a whole sub structure.
Writing such a converter(migration) for dict/list is straight forward, but with Pickle you'll have a hard time loading it in the first place.

If you do NOT have any interoperability requirements(e.g. you are just going to use the data with Python)
and a binary format is fine, go with cPickle which gives you really fast Python object serialization.

If you want interoperability or you want a text format to store your data, go with JSON(or some other appropriate format)
