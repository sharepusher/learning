## WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DES AND AES ENCRYPTION?

The time required to crack an encryption algorithm is directly related to the length of the key used to secure the communication.


# Data Encryption Standard (DES):
DES is a symmetric block cipher (shared secret key), with a key length of 56-bits.
Published as the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 46 standard in 1977,
DES was officially withdrawn in 2005 [although NIST has approved Triple DES (3DES) through 2030 for sensitive government information]

The federal government originally developed DES encryption over 35 years ago to provide cryptographic security for all government communications.
The idea was to ensure government systems all used the same, secure standard to facilitate interconnectivity.

Two organizations played key roles in breaking DES: distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
Even Triple DES (3DES), a way of using DES encryption three times, proved ineffective against brute force attacks (in addition to slowing down the process substantially).


Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):
Published as a FIPS 197 standard in 2001.
AES data encryption is a more mathematically efficient and elegant cryptographic algorithm, but its main strength rests in the option for various key lengths.
1) AES allows you to choose a 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key, making it exponentially stronger than the 56-bit key of DES.
2) In terms of structure, DES uses the Feistel network which divides the block into two halves before going through the encryption steps.
3) AES on the other hand, uses permutation-substitution, which involves a series of substitution and permutation steps to create the encrypted block.

The original DES designers made a great contribution to data security, but one could say that the aggregate effort of cryptographers for the AES algorithm has been far greater.

AES was chosen through an open competition with 15 candidates from as many research teams around the world, and the total amount of resources allocated to that process was tremendous.

Finally, in October 2000, a NIST press release announced the selection of Rijndael as the proposed Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
