# 1) contextmanager decorator make sure with keyword must be used on connection pool
# 2) whenever create a connection and then yield, finally will return the connection to pool
#    when exception occurred, it will refresh a new connection, in this case, it can make sure
#   that the connection returned to pool is always connected.
