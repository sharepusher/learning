TIL that http.Response.Body is a buffer, which means that once it has been read, it cannot be read again.

It's like a stream of water, you can see it and measure it as it passes but once it's gone, it's gone.

However, knowing this, there is a workaround, you need to "catch" the body and restore it:

// Read the Body content
var bodyBytes []byte
if context.Request.Body != nil {
    bodyBytes, _ = ioutil.ReadAll(context.Request.Body)
}

// Restore the io.ReadCloser to its original state
context.Request.Body = ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(bodyBytes))
