Your query should have date as

select * from table between `lowerdate` and `upperdate`

This is equivalent to the expression (min <= expr AND expr <= max)

## Be careful when compare date with timestamp, the date will be converted automatically to timestamp,
BUT the date will be converted with "00:00:00", in this case, the last day wont' be searched
