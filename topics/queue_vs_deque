# Summary
# Queue.Queue - threads communication
# deque - data structure

# Queue.Queue and collections.deque serve different purposes.
# Queue.Queue is intended for allowing different threads to communicate using queued messages/data,
# whereas collections.deque is simply intended as a datastructure.
# That's why Queue.Queue has methods like put_nowait(), get_nowait(), and join(), 
# whereas collections.deque doesn't.
# Queue.Queue isn't intended to be used as a collection, which is why it lacks the likes of the 'in' operator.

# It boils down to this:
# If you have multiple threads and you want them to be able to communicate without the need for locks, you're looking for Queue;
# If you just want a queue or a double-ended queue as datastructure, use collections.deque.
