## Apache Bench for Load Testing
# AB( Apache Bench) is a command line utility to measure performance of any web server. Itâ€™s originally designed to test the Apache HTTP server.
1) Running ab is like a denial-of-service attack.
2) Use verbose to debug a high number of failed requests
3) Be mindful of unnecessary variance in network latency
4) Use keep-alive, but know it may be faulty
5) Better simulate a realistic load scenario
