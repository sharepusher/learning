## why use mongoengine
1) Django does NOT support mongodb officially, though they have a plan to make it in the future;
2) pymongo is straightforward but we have to maintain the db connection and CRUD.
3) django-nonrel, i.e. Django non relationship. 
   django-norel is implemented by simulating the SQL operation in memory,
   which is not supported by Django, so it's just an external version
4) mongoengine, provide similar operation experience as Django Model(ORM).
