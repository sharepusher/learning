Job control is nothing but the ability to stop/suspend the execution of processes
and continue/resume their execution as per your requirements.

# bg
restart a stopped background process.
# fg
moves a background job in the current shell env into the foreground.

# disown
Remove jobs from current shell
To delete/remove jobs or to tell the shell not to send a HUP signal use disown command 

Pass -a option to disown all jobs
Pass -r option to disown only running jobs

# keep running job after exit from a shell prompt in background
-h option mark each jobID so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the shell recieves a SIGHUP.

# nohup command can also used to set the signal SIGHUP to be ignored
