// 1. In Python 2.x, you would do
isinstance(s, basestring)

basestring is the abstract superclass of str and unicode. It can be used to test whether an object is an instance of str or unicode.

// 2. In Python 3.x, the correct test is

isinstance(s, str)

The bytes class isn't considered a string type in Python 3.

// 3. six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library which already covers this issue. You can then do something like this:

import six

if isinstance(value, six.string_types):
    pass # It's a string !!
