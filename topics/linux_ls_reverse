## Linux / Unix: Sort ls Command Output By Last Modified Date and Time

## Ans:
You need to pass the -t option to the ls command. 
The -t option sort by time modified i.e. most recently modified first before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

ls -t
ls -lt | less
ls -lt ~/Downloads/ | less


Pass the -r option to reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first 
(or largest files last, if combined with sort by size), enter:
ls -tr
ls -ltr | less
ls -ltr ~/Downloads/ | less

# Sort by modification time, newest first and other options
Make sure you pass the -A (list all entries except for . and ..) or -a (include directory entries whose names begin with a dot) option to see hidden files:
ls -Altr ~/Downloads/ | less
ls -alt ~/Downloads/ | less
