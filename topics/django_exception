## How to catch db query DoesNotExist exception of django?
DoesNotExist is a property of the model itself, therefore, it's YouModelName.DoesNotExist.

You can also import ObjectDoesNotExist from django.core.exceptions, if you want a generic model-independent way to catch the exception.

from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
try:
    SomeModel.objects.get(pk=1)
except ObjectDoesNotExist:
    print("Error msg")
