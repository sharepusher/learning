## Description
sys.getsizeof(object[, default])
Return the size of an object in bytes. The object can be any type of object. 
All built-in objects will return correct results, but this does not have to hold true for third-party extensions as it is implementation specific.

If given, default will be returned if the object does not provide means to retrieve the size. Otherwise a TypeError will be raised
getsizeof() calls the objectâ€™s __sizeof__ method and adds an additional garbage collector overhead if the object is managed by the garbage collector.
