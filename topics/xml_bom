## BOM - Byte-Order-Mark
# is a special marker added at the very beginning of an Unicode file encoded in UTF-8,UTF-16 or UTF-32.
# It is used to indicate whether the file uses the big-endian or little endian byte order.
# The BOM is mandatory for UTF-16 and UTF-32, but it is optional for UTF-8

# For ANSI XML file it should actually be removed.
# UTF-8 don't really need it.
# ONLY UTF-16 and UTF-32 needed it.
# Always make sure ethe XML declaration <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The byte order mark is likely to be one of these byte sequences:

     UTF-8 BOM: ef bb bf
  UTF-16BE BOM: fe ff
  UTF-16LE BOM: ff fe
  UTF-32BE BOM: 00 00 fe ff
  UTF-32LE BOM: ff fe 00 00
