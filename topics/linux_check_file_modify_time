# atime, ctime and mtime in Unix filesystems
Unix filesystems stores a number of timestamps for each file: 
1) last accessed(read from or written to) - atime
2) changed(file access permissions were changed) - ctime
3) modified(written to) - mtime

There's no file creation timestamp kept in most filesystems. This said, it's usually possible to deduce the same from ctime and mtime
if they match, this probably means that's when the file was created.


* ls -l**, which shows you the time of the last file modification – mtime.

ls -lc will show you the last time our file was changed, ctime

 ls -lu will show you the access time

 # Show atime, ctime and mtime with stat command
 Linux distribution provides stat command.

# stat /tmp/file1 File
