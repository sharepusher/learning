## Collect keys, sort and iterate by the sorted keys

Collect all keys, sort them and iterate your map by key, like the following:

keys := make([]int, 0)
for k, _ := range romanNumeralDict {
    keys = append(keys, k)
}
sort.Ints(keys)
for _, k := range keys {
    fmt.Println(k, romanNumeralDict[k])
}


sort.Strings(keys)
