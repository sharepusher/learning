## Reference
# https://developpaper.com/redis-replaces-keys-instruction-with-scan-instruction-detailed/

## Redis replaces "keys" with "scan"
# The larger the number of keys in redis, the slower the keys command is executed.
# For single-threaded redis, it is a disaster.

# SCAN commands and their associated HSCAN and ZSCAN are used for incremental iteration of a collection of elements.

# The SCAN command is used to iterate over database keys in the current database.
# The SSCAN command is used to iterate over elements in the set key
# The HSCAN command is used to iterate over key-value pairs in hash keys
# The ZSCAN command is used to iterate over elements in an ordered set(including element memebers and element scores)

# The four commands listed above all support incremental iteration, which returns only a small number of elements each time
# they are executed, so they are used in production environment without problems like KEYS or SMEMEMBERS command
# when KEYS or SMEMEMBERS process a large collection key, they may block the server for several seconds.

# However, incremental iteration commmands are not without drawbacks:
# SMEMEMBERS commands can return all the elements currently contained in a collection key, 
# but for incremental iteration commands like SCAN, keys may be modified during incremental iteration, 
# therefore, incremental iteration Generation can only provide limited guarantees about the returned elements.

## Instruciton
# 1) The first parameter of SSCAN/HSCAN/ZSCAN is always a database key.
# 2) The SCAN command does NOT need to provide any database keys in the first parameter 
#    because it iterates over all database keys in the current database.
